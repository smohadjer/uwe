## Updating Website on GitHub 
### Adding a new page
1. To add a new page, you can copy content of an existing .hbs file, then create a new .hbs file and paste the content in it. To do this select any .hbs file in your website and then click on <img width="22" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-24 at 21 46 27" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1375720/203860858-2dcd304f-13b3-4f28-a353-9a68aa2b89de.png"> with label `Copy raw contents`. Then go to `app` folder and click the `Add file` button and select `Create new file`. Use a name that only has lowercase letters and no space with extension .hbs. Paste the content you had copies inside it and press <img width="110" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-24 at 21 47 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1375720/203860961-14e97ea0-58c3-4844-ba3c-556657d33c34.png"> button. The file is now added to `app` folder.
2. Every .hbs file needs a .html file with same name in content folder, so go to `app/content/` and repeat previous step to create a new .html file with same exact name there. 
3. Now click on `Actions` tab and check state of build and deployment process. As soon as it's finished you can access the new page in your website.
